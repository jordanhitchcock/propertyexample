    "One great benefit to holding children as regular attributes--rather than, say, in a list--is that it allows navigation over the tree both by directly accessing attributes _and_ by search conditions. For example, if you had an income statement model for a multi-national consumer business and wanted to see retention for a specific cohort of a specific product, you might access that data directly with something like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "statement.revenue.americas.productyyy.cohortzzz.retention(...)\n",

Searching the entire tree every time a series is called with new parameters can significantly slow down results depending on the complexity of the tree. Accessing references directly when they are known ahead of time (for example, within the same class or required child attributes) improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there isn't an easy way to clear `memoized_series` caches. This means the flexibilty of dynamically looking up references to other series is compromised by the fact that functions within the tree may already store results from previous references. In generally, the risk of accidentally using outdated function results is a big risk of caching functions that are not pure functions. Some ideas to help manage this risk include i) run calculation cycles in a context manager that clears cached results on entering and exiting the context, and ii) create a new instance for every calculation cycle that is thrown away afterwards."
